# Icons

The Puzzle Shell uses the [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) icon set, which is Apache 2.0 licensed.

You can grab additional icons from the [full list icons](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line).

## Optimization

When downloading icon SVGs, make sure to process them as follows:

- Optimize them with [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/):
  - Copy the SVGs markup
  - Goto [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) and use "Paste markup"
  - Copy the reduced SVG (copy icon on the bottom right)
- Replace all `fill="..."` and `stroke="..."` color values with `currentColor` for the icon to use the actual color of the HTML parent
- Use the icon ðŸš€
